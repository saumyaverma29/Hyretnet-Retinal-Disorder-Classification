Hybrid CNN–Transformer Model for Retinal Vascular Disorder Classification

This repository contains the official implementation of a hybrid CNN–Transformer deep learning framework for the classification of retinal vascular disorders from fundus images. The work focuses on accurate, robust, and well-calibrated multi-class classification of Hypertensive Retinopathy (HR), Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), and Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO).

The codebase supports ablation studies, advanced evaluation metrics, calibration analysis, repeated validation, and confidence interval estimation, ensuring strong scientific rigor and reproducibility.
